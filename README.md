-  Hey, Iâ€™m @DevfromtheV0id
-  Iâ€™m currently interested in ethical hacking, creating and managing file sharing servers and countering echoes of the dead internet among many other things.
-  Iâ€™m currently learning java, C, HTML, CSS, JavaScript. I'm very much a novice and would appreciate new learning opportunities.
-  Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything fun and challenging, related to linux systems and headless file servers.
